# Covid19--Data-Analysis-and-Visualisation


*In this project I have tried to analyze the effects of covid 19 on different states and then particularly on Delhi.

*I have used the dataset Covid_19_India.

*First I have tried to clean the data.

*Added a new column for active cases.

*First I have used the data to analyze all the states using tables and graphs.

*Then I have represented the cases only in Delhi using graphs

*Lastly I have compared the cases in Delhi.

*I have used comments so the code is self explanatory.
